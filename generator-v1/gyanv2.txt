get init state from device
 - always going to be a subset of the init state
think of ipso model as to what they are trying to arrive at. but this guys aren't constrained by ipso: these guys being wot and odm(one device/data model)
we are trying to do one step more than that by using the model and creating plans

show him an interesting example. one good example that helps us go ??
the example: typical example- for me to do something, something else has to happen. like some dependency graph.

there is a fire alarm that has gone off in room1. we want to move the important object like computer 1, 2, 3..
safeguard the computers. robot moves

goal: safe comp1 comp2 comp3 ....


another variation:
you cant move the computer without powering it off. once it shuts down, then you can move

network: all systems have to be connected. like comp1 is connected to lan1. when you move it to room2 for safe, you have to connect it to lan2.

submit a write up:
 - exp with pddl and the planners
 - more focus on the issues we faced: env file, domain files etc.
